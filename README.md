**MyContacts-React-Redux**
<hr />
This is a simple implementation of a my contacts website implemented using React/Redux. It shows how to properly use redux store to manage the various states of your website properly. It also shows the power of Redux as a whole. The list of contacts are returned while they are paginated hence it saves on the load time of your contacts as your contact list grows large.

This website has been created using the hosted API from [reques.in](https://reqres.in/) website. It supports all the CRUD operations with a minor flip in that since we can't actually post, delete or update any data from the server, we add the data to the Redux store which upon refresh will re-fetch the APIs default list removing all your alterations.
